Hello, and welcome to this chapter on data cleaning in a SQL database.

In the previous chapter we worked with the structure of the database, by manipulating it into a tidy format. 

In this chapter we will focus on the content of the data, by using SQL commands to transform the data from a messy state into a clean format that is ready for analysis.

Throughout this chapter, will be working with a database summarizing one year of property sales for each of the five New York City boroughs. Let's take a look at the table for Brooklyn.

As we learned in an earlier chapter, messy data cause problems when trying to analyze data. Whether you're analyzing data directly in a SQL database, or exporting data for analysis in R, Python or spreadsheets, messy data can create headaches for even the most simple data analysis tasks.

For example, let's take a look at the sale_price column from the brooklyn table.
