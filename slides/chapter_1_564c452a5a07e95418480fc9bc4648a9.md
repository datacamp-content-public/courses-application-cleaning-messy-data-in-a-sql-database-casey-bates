## Data Cleaning for Analysis in a SQL Database

Hello, and welcome to this chapter on data cleaning in a SQL database.

In the previous chapter, we worked with the structure of the database, by manipulating it into a tidy format. 

In this chapter, we will focus on the content of the data, by using SQL commands to transform the data from a messy state into a clean format that is ready for analysis.

## String Manipulation in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "6028fb8079"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT * 
FROM brooklyn;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/de04b7882315b286510e21db56bafa7038bc05fc/brooklyn.png){{2}}


`@script`
Throughout this chapter, will be working with a database summarizing one year of property sales for each of the five New York City boroughs. Let's take a look at the table for Brooklyn.

As we learned in an earlier chapter, messy data cause problems when trying to analyze data. Whether you're analyzing data directly in a SQL database, or exporting data for analysis in R, Python or spreadsheets, messy data can create headaches for even the most simple data analysis tasks.

For example, let's take a look at the sale_price column from the brooklyn table.

## Examining the sale_price column

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c882088330"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT sale_price 
FROM brooklyn
ORDER BY sale_price DESC;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/343ba6707e156ea691db239e3443852e90e67e0e/sale_price_order_by.png){{2}}


`@script`
For example, let's take a look at the sale_price column from the brooklyn table. 

Running a SQL command to order the results by highest to lowest sale price might seem simple enough at first, and running this query appears to work...but a closer look at the sale_price column reveals that this column is being stored as a string, NOT a number. 

And although we did not get an error, and the query appears to have worked, further inspection reveals a problem; these sale_price values are actually not perfectly ordered by sale_price.

Why is this column being stored as a string? The reason is because of the special characters; the commas, and the dollar sign.

## The replace() function in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7098b8ab78"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
replace(source string, pattern, replacement){{1}}

```
SELECT replace(sale_price,
```{{2}}


`@script`
The replace() function can be used to search and replace all occurrences of a string, such as a special character, with a new one. 

For example, to remove the dollar sign from the sale_price column we would provide 3 arguments:
1. The sale_price column as the source string
2. The text you would like to replace, and
3. The new text to insert

If you apply the replace function to commas, it will remove all commas in every row, not just the first instance.

## The regexp_replace() function in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "1704693ad6"
```

`@part1`
regexp_replace(sring, pattern, replacement, flags)

```
SELECT regexp_replace(sale_price, '[\$]', '') AS sale_price_new
FROM brooklyn;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/36a859d7bfc9062a156ff535d41c0e65ba6e879a/replace_result.png){{2}}


`@script`
For more advanced applications of string manipulation, you may find it useful to work with regular expressions. Let's take a look at how we can use the regexp_replace() function to remove the dollar sign from the sale_price column.  

The function takes 4 arguments:
1. The source string to be replaced: the sale_price column
2. The pattern, a regular expression, to be replaced...the dollar sign
3. The replacement string or pattern, and finally... 
4. an optional argument for Flags, which control the matching behavior. We'll discuss flags in more detail in a moment.

Let's run this query and inspect our results. It worked. We now have a column called sale_price_new that no longer has dollar signs.

We had to escape the dollar sign with a backslash, because in regular expressions the dollar is used for matches at the end of the string.

That's a great first step. Let's expand the regular expression pattern to remove commas as well.

## Getting Greedy

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bb2e245a03"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT regexp_replace(sale_price, '[\$,]', '', 'g') AS sale_price_new
FROM brooklyn;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/a101d47c8a4b42cf606c2ce5b18c1a8d3806830a/regexp_result.png){{2}}


`@script`
Because there may be more than one comma, we need to specify the 'g' flag in the regexp pattern, to make the replace function greedy. 

In this lesson, you learned how to search and replace string patterns. Later on we will learn how to apply these changes to the data in the database.

In the meantime, let's practice what we've learned.

## Let's get started!

```yaml

```

`@script`
Alright, now it's your turn to give it a shot.
