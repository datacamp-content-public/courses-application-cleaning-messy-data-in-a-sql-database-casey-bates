## Data Cleaning for Analysis in a SQL Database

Hello, and welcome to this chapter on data cleaning in a SQL database.

In the previous chapter, we worked with the structure of the database, by manipulating it into a tidy format. 

In this chapter, we will focus on the content of the data, by using SQL commands to transform the data from a messy state into a clean format that is ready for analysis.

## String Manipulation in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "6028fb8079"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT * 
FROM brooklyn;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/de04b7882315b286510e21db56bafa7038bc05fc/brooklyn.png){{2}}


`@script`
Throughout this chapter, we'll be working with a database summarizing one year of property sales for each of the five New York City boroughs. Let's take a look at the table for Brooklyn.

As we learned earlier in the course, messy data cause problems when trying to analyze data. Whether you're analyzing data directly in a SQL database, or exporting data for analysis in R, Python or spreadsheets, messy data can create headaches for even the most simple data analysis tasks.

For example, let's take a look at the sale_price column from the brooklyn table.

## Identifying Messy Data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c882088330"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT sale_price 
FROM brooklyn
ORDER BY sale_price DESC;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/343ba6707e156ea691db239e3443852e90e67e0e/sale_price_order_by.png){{2}}


`@script`
Running a SQL command to order the results by highest to lowest sale price might seem simple enough at first, and running this query appears to work...but a closer look at the sale_price column reveals that this column is being stored as a string, NOT a number. 

And although we did not get an error, and the query appears to have worked, further inspection reveals a problem; these sale_price values are actually not perfectly ordered by sale_price.

Why is this column storing values as strings? Because of the special characters; the comma, and the dollar sign.

## The replace() function in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7098b8ab78"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
replace(source string, pattern, replacement){{1}}

```
SELECT replace(sale_price,
```{{2}}


`@script`
The replace() function in SQL can be used to search and replace all occurrences of a string (such as a special character) with a new one. 

For example, to remove the dollar sign from the sale_price column we would provide 3 arguments:
1. The sale_price column, as the source string
2. The text you would like to replace, and
3. The new text to insert

If you apply the replace function to commas, it will remove all commas, not just the first instance in each row.

## The regexp_replace() function in PostgreSQL

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "376edbf9a7"
```

`@part1`
regexp_replace(source sring, pattern, replacement, flags)

- Source string (e.g 'sale_price' column){{1}}

- The pattern to be replaced (e.g. '[\$]'){{2}}

- The replacement {{3}}

- Optional flags that control matching behavior {{4}}


`@script`
For more advanced applications of string manipulation, you may find it useful to work with regular expressions. Let's take a look at how we can use the regexp_replace() function to remove the dollar sign from the sale_price column.  

The function takes 4 arguments:
1. The source string to be replaced: the sale_price column
2. The pattern, a regular expression, to be replaced...the dollar sign
3. The replacement string or pattern, and finally... 
4. an optional argument for Flags, which control the matching behavior. We'll discuss flags in more detail in a moment.

Let's run this query and inspect our results. It worked. We now have a column called sale_price_new that no longer has dollar signs.

Note that we had to escape the dollar sign with a backslash, because when using regular expressions, the dollar is used to match from the end of a string.

This is a great first step. Let's expand the regular expression pattern to remove commas as well.

## Greedy operations

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "bb2e245a03"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT regexp_replace(sale_price, '[\$,]', '', 'g') AS sale_price_new
FROM brooklyn;
```{{1}}

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4212/datasets/a101d47c8a4b42cf606c2ce5b18c1a8d3806830a/regexp_result.png){{2}}


`@script`
Because there may be more than one comma in each row, we need to specify the 'g' flag in the regexp pattern. This will make the replace function "greedy", causing the function to replace all commas. 

In this lesson, you learned how to search and replace string patterns using SQL commands. Later on, we'll learn how to apply these changes to the data stored in the database.

Let's practice what we've learned so far.

## Let's get started!

Alright, now it's your turn to give it a shot.
